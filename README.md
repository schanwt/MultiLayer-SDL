# MultiLayer Supervised Dictionary Learning
Code done during my phd thesis in GIPSA-lab on multilayer supervised dictionary learning for classification.

The proposed method uses multiple layers of sparse coding to compute discriminant features for classification.

The main features of the architecture are described in the paper : 
Multi-layer Dictionary Learning for Image Classification, S. CHAN WAI TIM, M. ROMBAUT and D. PELLERIN, ACIVS, 2016.

If you use the code please cite the above paper.
